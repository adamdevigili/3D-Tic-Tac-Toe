# 3D-Tic-Tac-Toe

Description
-----------
3 dimensional tic-tac-toe game. This game uses the MiniMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to choose the correct moves for the A.I player. Varying levels of difficulty are implemented by controlling how far into the move tree the algorithm looks ahead.

This was a mid-term project for my sophomore A.I. class. That's why it looks...the way it does ðŸ˜„.
